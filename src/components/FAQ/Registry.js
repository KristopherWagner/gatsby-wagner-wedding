        Do you have a registry?

      <p className="body1">
        We have decided to not have a registry; we understand that attending our wedding is
        expensive, and your presence is the best gift. However, if you wish to give, we will
        gratefully accept a small contribution towards our honeymoon, next home, or joining
        Disney&apos;s Vacation Club. Alternatively, we would be honored if you would consider
        making a donation to one of our favorite charities in lieu of a traditional wedding gift.
