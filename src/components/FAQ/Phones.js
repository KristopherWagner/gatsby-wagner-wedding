        Can I use my phone to take pictures during the ceremony?

        As we celebrate our love and commitment to each other, we ask that our guests take this
        opportunity to be fully present and enjoy the moment with us. In order to create a truly
        special and memorable experience for everyone, we kindly request that guests limit their
        phone usage during the reception and turn them off during the ceremony. We understand that
        it can be tempting to document every moment, so we have hired professionals to photograph,
        record and live stream our events; we hope that you will take this opportunity to be fully
        present and fully engaged in the celebration. Thank you for helping to create a meaningful
        and special day for us all.
