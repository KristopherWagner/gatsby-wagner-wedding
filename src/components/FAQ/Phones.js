        As we celebrate our love and commitment to each other, we ask that our guests take this
        opportunity to be fully present and enjoy the moment with us. In order to create a truly
        special and memorable experience for everyone, we kindly request that guests limit their
        phone usage during the reception and
        {' '}
        <Bold>turn them off during the ceremony</Bold>
        . We understand that
        it can be tempting to document every moment, so we have hired professionals to photograph,
        record and live stream our events; we hope that you will take this opportunity to be fully
        present and fully engaged in the celebration. Thank you for helping to create a meaningful
        and special day for us all.
